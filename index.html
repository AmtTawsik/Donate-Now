                <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood, hurricane or blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the event of disaster. </p>

People are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge, sometimes for short time and sometimes for a protracted period based on the nature of the disaster and the extent of the damage done to the housing structures. </p>
